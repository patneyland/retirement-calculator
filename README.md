# retirement-calculator

This is the code for a more robust and transparent calculator. Most retirment calculators I have found online are complete black boxes with flawed assumptions and completely ignoring taxes. 
This calculator aims to rationally consider returns, taxes, inflation, and human behavior while also being open source and completely transparent about all calculations and assumptions.
